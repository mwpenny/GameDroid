The gameboy is having a 16bit address bus, that is used to address ROM, 
RAM, and I/O registers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>General Memory Map<BR>
</B><TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  0000-3FFF   16KB ROM Bank 00     (in cartridge, fixed at bank 00)
  4000-7FFF   16KB ROM Bank 01..NN (in cartridge, switchable bank number)

  FF00-FF7F   I/O Ports
  FF80-FFFE   High RAM (HRAM)
  FFFF        Interrupt Enable Register
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Jump Vectors in First ROM Bank<BR>
</B>The following addresses are supposed to be used as jump vectors:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  0000,0008,0010,0018,0020,0028,0030,0038   for RST commands
  0040,0048,0050,0058,0060                  for Interrupts
</TD></TR></TABLE>However, the memory may be used for any other purpose in case that your 
program doesn't use any (or only some) RST commands or Interrupts. RST 
commands are 1-byte opcodes that work similiar to CALL opcodes, except 
that the destination address is fixed.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Cartridge Header in First ROM Bank<BR>
</B>The memory at 0100-014F contains the cartridge header. This area 
contains information about the program, its entry point, checksums, 
information about the used MBC chip, the ROM and RAM sizes, etc. Most of 
the bytes in this area are required to be specified correctly. For more 
information read the chapter about The Cartridge Header.<BR>
<BR>
<B>External Memory and Hardware<BR>
</B>The areas from 0000-7FFF and A000-BFFF may be used to connect external 
hardware. The first area is typically used to address ROM (read only, of 
course), cartridges with Memory Bank Controllers (MBCs) are additionally 
using this area to output data (write only) to the MBC chip. The second 
area is often used to address external RAM, or to address other external 
hardware (Real Time Clock, etc). External memory is often battery 
buffered, and may hold saved game positions and high scrore tables 
(etc.) even when the gameboy is turned of, or when the cartridge is 
removed. For specific information read the chapter about Memory Bank 
Controllers.<BR>

<B>LCDC.7 - LCD Display Enable<BR>
</B>CAUTION: Stopping LCD operation (Bit 7 from 1 to 0) may be performed 
during V-Blank ONLY, disabeling the display outside of the V-Blank 
period may damage the hardware. This appears to be a serious issue, 
Nintendo is reported to reject any games that do not follow this rule.<BR>
V-blank can be confirmed when the value of LY is greater than or equal 
to 144. When the display is disabled the screen is blank (white), and 
VRAM and OAM can be accessed freely.<BR>
<BR>
--- LCDC.0 has different Meanings depending on Gameboy Type ---<BR>
<BR>
<B>LCDC.0 - 1) Monochrome Gameboy and SGB: BG Display<BR>
</B>When Bit 0 is cleared, the background becomes blank (white). Window and 
Sprites may still be displayed (if enabled in Bit 1 and/or Bit 5).<BR>
<BR>
<B>LCDC.0 - 2) CGB in CGB Mode: BG and Window Master Priority<BR>
</B>When Bit 0 is cleared, the background and window lose their priority - 
the sprites will be always displayed on top of background and window, 
independently of the priority flags in OAM and BG Map attributes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>LCDC.0 - 3) CGB in Non CGB Mode: BG and Window Display<BR>
</B>When Bit 0 is cleared, both background and window become blank (white), 
ie. the Window Display Bit (Bit 5) is ignored in that case. Only Sprites 
may still be displayed (if enabled in Bit 1).<BR>
This is a possible compatibility problem - any monochrome games (if any) 
that disable the background, but still want to display the window 
wouldn't work properly on CGBs.<BR>

The two lower STAT bits show the current status of the LCD controller.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Mode 0: The LCD controller is in the H-Blank period and
          the CPU can access both the display RAM (8000h-9FFFh)
          and OAM (FE00h-FE9Fh)
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Mode 1: The LCD contoller is in the V-Blank period (or the
          display is disabled) and the CPU can access both the
          display RAM (8000h-9FFFh) and OAM (FE00h-FE9Fh)
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Mode 2: The LCD controller is reading from OAM memory.
          The CPU &lt;cannot&gt; access OAM memory (FE00h-FE9Fh)
          during this period.
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Mode 3: The LCD controller is reading from both OAM and VRAM,
          The CPU &lt;cannot&gt; access OAM and VRAM during this period.
          CGB Mode: Cannot access Palette Data (FF69,FF6B) either.
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
The following are typical when the display is enabled:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Mode 2  2_____2_____2_____2_____2_____2___________________2____

</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
The Mode Flag goes through the values 0, 2, and 3 at a cycle of about 
109uS. 0 is present about 48.6uS, 2 about 19uS, and 3 about 41uS. This 
is interrupted every 16.6ms by the VBlank (1). The mode flag stays set 
at 1 for about 1.08 ms.<BR>
<BR>
Mode 0 is present between 201-207 clks, 2 about 77-83 clks, and 3 about 
169-175 clks. A complete cycle through these states takes 456 clks. 
VBlank lasts 4560 clks. A complete screen refresh occurs every 70224 
clks.)<BR>

<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="lcdinterrupts"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;LCD Interrupts</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>INT 40 - V-Blank Interrupt<BR>
</B>The V-Blank interrupt occurs ca. 59.7 times a second on a regular GB and 
ca. 61.1 times a second on a Super GB (SGB). This interrupt occurs at 
the beginning of the V-Blank period (LY=144).<BR>
During this period video hardware is not using video ram so it may be 
freely accessed. This period lasts approximately 1.1 milliseconds.<BR>
<BR>
<B>INT 48 - LCDC Status Interrupt<BR>
</B>There are various reasons for this interrupt to occur as described by 
the STAT register ($FF40). One very popular reason is to indicate to the 
user when the video hardware is about to redraw a given LCD line. This 
can be useful for dynamically controlling the SCX/SCY registers 
($FF43/$FF42) to perform special video effects.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="lcdpositionandscrolling"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;LCD Position and Scrolling</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>FF42 - SCY - Scroll Y   (R/W)<BR>
FF43 - SCX - Scroll X   (R/W)<BR>
</B>Specifies the position in the 256x256 pixels BG map (32x32 tiles) which 
is to be displayed at the upper/left LCD display position.<BR>
Values in range from 0-255 may be used for X/Y each, the video 
controller automatically wraps back to the upper (left) position in BG 
map when drawing exceeds the lower (right) border of the BG map area.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FF44 - LY - LCDC Y-Coordinate (R)<BR>
</B>The LY indicates the vertical line to which the present data is 
transferred to the LCD Driver. The LY can take on any value between 0 
through 153. The values between 144 and 153 indicate the V-Blank period. 
Writing will reset the counter.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FF45 - LYC - LY Compare  (R/W)<BR>
</B>The gameboy permanently compares the value of the LYC and LY registers. 
When both values are identical, the coincident bit in the STAT register 
becomes set, and (if enabled) a STAT interrupt is requested.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FF4A - WY - Window Y Position (R/W)<BR>
FF4B - WX - Window X Position minus 7 (R/W)<BR>
</B>Specifies the upper/left positions of the Window area. (The window is an 
alternate background area which can be displayed above of the normal 
background. OBJs (sprites) may be still displayed above or behinf the 
window, just as for normal BG.)<BR>
The window becomes visible (if enabled) when positions are set in range 
WX=0..166, WY=0..143. A postion of WX=7, WY=0 locates the window at 
upper left, it is then completly covering normal background.<BR>

Window tiles.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Bit 7-6 - Shade for Color Number 3

<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  0  White
  1  Light gray

  3  Black
</TD></TR></TABLE>In CGB Mode the Color Palettes are taken from CGB Palette Memory 
instead.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FF48 - OBP0 - Object Palette 0 Data (R/W) - Non CGB Mode Only<BR>
</B>This register assigns gray shades for sprite palette 0. It works exactly 
as BGP (FF47), except that the lower two bits aren't used because sprite 
data 00 is transparent.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FF49 - OBP1 - Object Palette 1 Data (R/W) - Non CGB Mode Only<BR>
</B>This register assigns gray shades for sprite palette 1. It works exactly 
as BGP (FF47), except that the lower two bits aren't used because sprite

<B>FF68 - BCPS/BGPI - CGB Mode Only - Background Palette Index<BR>
</B>This register is used to address a byte in the CGBs Background Palette 
Memory. Each two byte in that memory define a color value. The first 8 
bytes define Color 0-3 of Palette 0 (BGP0), and so on for BGP1-7.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Bit 0-5   Index (00-3F)
  Bit 7     Auto Increment  (0=Disabled, 1=Increment after Writing)
</TD></TR></TABLE>Data can be read/written to/from the specified index address through 
Register FF69. When the Auto Increment Bit is set then the index is 
automatically incremented after each &lt;write&gt; to FF69. Auto Increment has 
no effect when &lt;reading&gt; from FF69, so the index must be manually 
incremented in that case.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FF69 - BCPD/BGPD - CGB Mode Only - Background Palette Data<BR>
</B>This register allows to read/write data to the CGBs Background Palette 
Memory, addressed through Register FF68.<BR>
Each color is defined by two bytes (Bit 0-7 in first byte).<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Bit 0-4   Red Intensity   (00-1F)
  Bit 5-9   Green Intensity (00-1F)
  Bit 10-14 Blue Intensity  (00-1F)
</TD></TR></TABLE>Much like VRAM, Data in Palette Memory cannot be read/written during the 
time when the LCD Controller is reading from it. (That is when the STAT 
register indicates Mode 3).<BR>
Note: Initially all background colors are initialized as white.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FF6A - OCPS/OBPI - CGB Mode Only - Sprite Palette Index<BR>
FF6B - OCPD/OBPD - CGB Mode Only - Sprite Palette Data<BR>
</B>These registers are used to initialize the Sprite Palettes OBP0-7, 
identically as described above for Background Palettes. Note that four 
colors may be defined for each OBP Palettes - but only Color 1-3 of each 
Sprite Palette can be displayed, Color 0 is always transparent, and can 
be initialized to a don't care value.<BR>
Note: Initially all sprite colors are uninitialized.<BR>
<BR>
<B>RGB Translation by CGBs<BR>
</B>When developing graphics on PCs, note that the RGB values will have 
different appearance on CGB displays as on VGA monitors:<BR>
The highest intensity will produce Light Gray color rather than White. 
The intensities are not linear; the values 10h-1Fh will all appear very 
bright, while medium and darker colors are ranged at 00h-0Fh.<BR>
The CGB display will mix colors quite oddly, increasing intensity of 
only one R,G,B color will also influence the other two R,G,B colors.<BR>
For example, a color setting of 03EFh (Blue=0, Green=1Fh, Red=0Fh) will 
appear as Neon Green on VGA displays, but on the CGB it'll produce a 
decently washed out Yellow.<BR>
<BR>
<B>RGB Translation by GBAs<BR>
</B>Even though GBA is described to be compatible to CGB games, most CGB 
games are completely unplayable on GBAs because most colors are 
invisible (black). Of course, colors such like Black and White will 
appear the same on both CGB and GBA, but medium intensities are arranged 
completely different.<BR>
Intensities in range 00h..0Fh are invisible/black (unless eventually 
under best sunlight circumstances, and when gazing at the screen under 
obscure viewing angles), unfortunately, these intensities are regulary 
used by most existing CGB games for medium and darker colors.<BR>
Newer CGB games may avoid this effect by changing palette data when 
detecting GBA hardware. A relative simple method would be using the 
formula GBA=CGB/2+10h for each R,G,B intensity, probably the result 
won't be perfect, and (once colors became visible) it may turn out that 
the color mixing is different also, anyways, it'd be still ways better 
than no conversion.<BR>
Asides, this translation method should have been VERY easy to implement 
in GBA hardware directly, even though Nintendo obviously failed to do 
so. How did they say, This seal is your assurance for excellence in 
workmanship and so on?<BR>

<B>FF46 - DMA - DMA Transfer and Start Address (W)<BR>
</B>Writing to this register launches a DMA transfer from ROM or RAM to OAM 
memory (sprite attribute table). The written value specifies the 
transfer source address divided by 100h, ie. source & destination are:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Source:      XX00-XX9F   ;XX in range from 00-F1h
  Destination: FE00-FE9F
</TD></TR></TABLE>It takes 160 microseconds until the transfer has completed (80 
microseconds in CGB Double Speed Mode), during this time the CPU can 
access only HRAM (memory at FF80-FFFE). For this reason, the programmer 
must copy a short procedure into HRAM, and use this procedure to start 
the transfer from inside HRAM, and wait until the transfer has finished:<BR>

</B>These registers are used to initiate a DMA transfer from ROM or RAM to 
VRAM. The Source Start Address may be located at 0000-7FF0 or A000-DFF0, 
the lower four bits of the address are ignored (treated as zero). The 
Destination Start Address may be located at 8000-9FF0, the lower four 
bits of the address are ignored (treated as zero), the upper 3 bits are 
ignored either (destination is always in VRAM).<BR>
<BR>
Writing to FF55 starts the transfer, the lower 7 bits of FF55 specify 
the Transfer Length (divided by 10h, minus 1). Ie. lengths of 10h-800h 
bytes can be defined by the values 00h-7Fh. And the upper bit of FF55 
indicates the Transfer Mode:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Bit7=0 - General Purpose DMA<BR>
</B>When using this transfer method, all data is transferred at once. The 
execution of the program is halted until the transfer has completed. 
Note that the General Purpose DMA blindly attempts to copy the data, 
even if the LCD controller is currently accessing VRAM. So General 
Purpose DMA should be used only if the Display is disabled, or during 
V-Blank, or (for rather short blocks) during H-Blank.<BR>
The execution of the program continues when the transfer has been 
completed, and FF55 then contains a value if FFh.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Bit7=1 - H-Blank DMA<BR>
</B>The H-Blank DMA transfers 10h bytes of data during each H-Blank, ie. at 
LY=0-143, no data is transferred during V-Blank (LY=144-153), but the 
transfer will then continue at LY=00. The execution of the program is 
halted during the separate transfers, but the program execution 
continues during the 'spaces' between each data block.<BR>
Note that the program may not change the Destination VRAM bank (FF4F), 
or the Source ROM/RAM bank (in case data is transferred from bankable 
memory) until the transfer has completed!<BR>
Reading from Register FF55 returns the remaining length (divided by 10h, 
minus 1), a value of 0FFh indicates that the transfer has completed. It 
is also possible to terminate an active H-Blank transfer by writing zero 
to Bit 7 of FF55. In that case reading from FF55 may return any value 
for the lower 7 bits, but Bit 7 will be read as "1".<BR>
<BR>
<B>Confirming if the DMA Transfer is Active<BR>
</B>Reading Bit 7 of FF55 can be used to confirm if the DMA transfer is 
active (1=Not Active, 0=Active). This works under any circumstances - 
after completion of General Purpose, or H-Blank Transfer, and after 
manually terminating a H-Blank Transfer.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Transfer Timings<BR>
</B>In both Normal Speed and Double Speed Mode it takes about 8us to 
transfer a block of 10h bytes. That are 8 cycles in Normal Speed Mode, 
and 16 'fast' cycles in Double Speed Mode.<BR>
Older MBC controllers (like MBC1-4) and slower ROMs are not guaranteed 
to support General Purpose or H-Blank DMA, that's because there are 
always 2 bytes transferred per microsecond (even if the itself program 
runs it Normal Speed Mode).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="vramtiledata"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;VRAM Tile Data</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
Tile Data is stored in VRAM at addresses 8000h-97FFh, this area defines 
the Bitmaps for 192 Tiles. In CGB Mode 384 Tiles can be defined, because 
memory at 0:8000h-97FFh and at 1:8000h-97FFh is used.<BR>
<BR>
Each tile is sized 8x8 pixels and has a color depth of 4 colors/gray 
shades. Tiles can be displayed as part of the Background/Window map, 
and/or as OAM tiles (foreground sprites). Note that foreground sprites 
may have only 3 colors, because color 0 is transparent.<BR>
<BR>
As it was said before, there are two Tile Pattern Tables at $8000-8FFF 
and at $8800-97FF. The first one can be used for sprites and the 
background. Its tiles are numbered from 0 to 255. The second table can 
be used for the background and the window display and its tiles are 
numbered from -128 to 127.<BR>
<BR>
Each Tile occupies 16 bytes, where each 2 bytes represent a line:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Byte 0-1  First Line (Upper 8 pixels)
  Byte 2-3  Next Line
  etc.
</TD></TR></TABLE>For each line, the first byte defines the least significant bits of the 
color numbers for each pixel, and the second byte defines the upper bits 
of the color numbers. In either case, Bit 7 is the leftmost pixel, and 
Bit 0 the rightmost.<BR>
<BR>
So, each pixel is having a color number in range from 0-3. The color 
numbers are translated into real colors (or gray shades) depending on 
the current palettes. The palettes are defined through registers 
FF47-FF49 (Non CGB Mode), and FF68-FF6B (CGB Mode).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="vrambackgroundmaps"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;VRAM Background Maps</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
The gameboy contains two 32x32 tile background maps in VRAM at addresses 
9800h-9BFFh and 9C00h-9FFFh. Each can be used either to display "normal" 
background, or "window" background.<BR>
<BR>
<B>BG Map Tile Numbers<BR>
</B>An area of VRAM known as Background Tile Map contains the numbers of 
tiles to be displayed. It is organized as 32 rows of 32 bytes each. Each 
byte contains a number of a tile to be displayed. Tile patterns are 
taken from the Tile Data Table located either at $8000-8FFF or 
$8800-97FF. In the first case, patterns are numbered with unsigned 
numbers from 0 to 255 (i.e. pattern #0 lies at address $8000). In the 
second case, patterns have signed numbers from -128 to 127 (i.e. pattern 
#0 lies at address $9000). The Tile Data Table address for the 
background can be selected via LCDC register.<BR>
<BR>
<B>BG Map Attributes (CGB Mode only)<BR>
</B>In CGB Mode, an additional map of 32x32 bytes is stored in VRAM Bank 1 
(each byte defines attributes for the corresponding tile-number map 
entry in VRAM Bank 0):<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Bit 0-2  Background Palette number  (BGP0-7)
  Bit 3    Tile VRAM Bank number      (0=Bank 0, 1=Bank 1)
  Bit 4    Not used
  Bit 5    Horizontal Flip            (0=Normal, 1=Mirror horizontally)
  Bit 6    Vertical Flip              (0=Normal, 1=Mirror vertically)
  Bit 7    BG-to-OAM Priority         (0=Use OAM priority bit, 1=BG Priority)
</TD></TR></TABLE>When Bit 7 is set, the corresponding BG tile will have priority above 
all OBJs (regardless of the priority bits in OAM memory). There's also 
an Master Priority flag in LCDC register Bit 0 which overrides all other 
priority bits when cleared.<BR>
<BR>
As one background tile has a size of 8x8 pixels, the BG maps may hold a 
picture of 256x256 pixels, an area of 160x144 pixels of this picture can 
be displayed on the LCD screen.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Normal Background (BG)<BR>
</B>The SCY and SCX registers can be used to scroll the background, allowing 
to select the origin of the visible 160x144 pixel area within the total 
256x256 pixel background map. Background wraps around the screen (i.e. 
when part of it goes off the screen, it appears on the opposite side.)<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Window<BR>
</B>Besides background, there is also a "window" overlaying the background. 
The window is not scrollable i.e. it is always displayed starting from 
its left upper corner. The location of a window on the screen can be 
adjusted via WX and WY registers. Screen coordinates of the top left 
corner of a window are WX-7,WY. The tiles for the window are stored in 
the Tile Data Table. Both the Background and the window share the same 
Tile Data Table.<BR>
<BR>
Both background and window can be disabled or enabled separately via 
bits in the LCDC register.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="vramspriteattributetableoam"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;VRAM Sprite Attribute Table (OAM)</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
GameBoy video controller can display up to 40 sprites either in 8x8 or 
in 8x16 pixels. Because of a limitation of hardware, only ten sprites 
can be displayed per scan line. Sprite patterns have the same format as 
BG tiles, but they are taken from the Sprite Pattern Table located at 
$8000-8FFF and have unsigned numbering.<BR>
<BR>
Sprite attributes reside in the Sprite Attribute Table (OAM - Object 
Attribute Memory) at $FE00-FE9F. Each of the 40 entries consists of four 
bytes with the following meanings:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Byte0 - Y Position<BR>
</B>Specifies the sprites vertical position on the screen (minus 16).<BR>
An offscreen value (for example, Y=0 or Y&gt;=160) hides the sprite.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Byte1 - X Position<BR>
</B>Specifies the sprites horizontal position on the screen (minus 8).<BR>
An offscreen value (X=0 or X&gt;=168) hides the sprite, but the sprite<BR>
still affects the priority ordering - a better way to hide a sprite is 
to set its Y-coordinate offscreen.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Byte2 - Tile/Pattern Number<BR>
</B>Specifies the sprites Tile Number (00-FF). This (unsigned) value selects 
a tile from memory at 8000h-8FFFh. In CGB Mode this could be either in 
VRAM Bank 0 or 1, depending on Bit 3 of the following byte.<BR>
In 8x16 mode, the lower bit of the tile number is ignored. Ie. the upper 
8x8 tile is "NN AND FEh", and the lower 8x8 tile is "NN OR 01h".<BR>
<BR>
<B>Byte3 - Attributes/Flags:<BR>
</B><TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Bit7   OBJ-to-BG Priority (0=OBJ Above BG, 1=OBJ Behind BG color 1-3)
         (Used for both BG and Window. BG color 0 is always behind OBJ)

  Bit5   X flip          (0=Normal, 1=Horizontally mirrored)

  Bit2-0 Palette number  **CGB Mode Only**     (OBP0-7)
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Sprite Priorities and Conflicts<BR>
</B>When sprites with different x coordinate values overlap, the one with 
the smaller x coordinate (closer to the left) will have priority and 
appear above any others. This applies in Non CGB Mode only.<BR>
When sprites with the same x coordinate values overlap, they have 
priority according to table ordering. (i.e. $FE00 - highest, $FE04 - 
next highest, etc.) In CGB Mode priorities are always assigned like 
this.<BR>
<BR>
Only 10 sprites can be displayed on any one line. When this limit is 
exceeded, the lower priority sprites (priorities listed above) won't be 
displayed. To keep unused sprites from affecting onscreen sprites set 
their Y coordinate to Y=0 or Y=&gt;144+16. Just setting the X coordinate to 
X=0 or X=&gt;160+8 on a sprite will hide it but it will still affect other 
sprites sharing the same lines.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Writing Data to OAM Memory<BR>
</B>The recommened method is to write the data to normal RAM first, and to 
copy that RAM to OAM by using the DMA transfer function, initiated 
through DMA register (FF46).<BR>
Beside for that, it is also possible to write data directly to the OAM 
area by using normal LD commands, this works only during the H-Blank and 
V-Blank periods. The current state of the LCD controller can be read out 
from the STAT register (FF41).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="accessingvramandoam"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;Accessing VRAM and OAM</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>CAUTION<BR>
</B>When the LCD Controller is drawing the screen it is directly reading 
from Video Memory (VRAM) and from the Sprite Attribute Table (OAM). 
During these periods the Gameboy CPU may not access the VRAM and OAM. 
That means, any attempts to write to VRAM/OAM are ignored (the data 
remains unchanged). And any attempts to read from VRAM/OAM will return 
undefined data (typically a value of FFh).<BR>
<BR>
For this reason the program should verify if VRAM/OAM is accessable 
before actually reading or writing to it. This is usually done by 
reading the Mode Bits from the STAT Register (FF41). When doing this (as 
described in the examples below) you should take care that no interrupts 
occur between the wait loops and the following memory access - the 
memory is guaranted to be accessable only for a few cycles directly 
after the wait loops have completed.<BR>
<BR>
<B>VRAM (memory at 8000h-9FFFh) is accessable during Mode 0-2<BR>
</B><TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Mode 0 - H-Blank Period,
  Mode 1 - V-Blank Period, and
  Mode 2 - Searching OAM Period
</TD></TR></TABLE>A typical procedure that waits for accessibility of VRAM would be:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  ld   hl,0FF41h    ;-STAT Register
 @@wait:            ;\
  bit  1,(hl)       ; Wait until Mode is 0 or 1
  jr   nz,@@wait    ;/
</TD></TR></TABLE>Even if the procedure gets executed at the &lt;end&gt; of Mode 0 or 1, it is 
still proof to assume that VRAM can be accessed for a few more cycles 
because in either case the following period is Mode 2 which allows 
access to VRAM either.<BR>
In CGB Mode an alternate method to write data to VRAM is to use the HDMA 
Function (FF51-FF55).<BR>
<BR>
<B>OAM (memory at FE00h-FE9Fh) is accessable during Mode 0-1<BR>
</B><TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Mode 0 - H-Blank Period, and
  Mode 1 - V-Blank Period
</TD></TR></TABLE>Beside for that, OAM can be accessed at any time by using the DMA 
Function (FF46). When directly reading or writing to OAM, a typical 
procedure that waits for accessibilty or OAM Memory would be:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  ld   hl,0FF41h    ;-STAT Register
 @@wait1:           ;\
  bit  1,(hl)       ; Wait until Mode is -NOT- 0 or 1
  jr   z,@@wait1    ;/
 @@wait2:           ;\
  bit  1,(hl)       ; Wait until Mode 0 or 1 -BEGINS-
  jr   nz,@@wait2   ;/
</TD></TR></TABLE>The two wait loops ensure that Mode 0 or 1 will last for a few clock 
cycles after completion of the procedure. In V-Blank period it might be 
recommended to skip the whole procedure - and in most cases using the 
above mentioned DMA function would be more recommended anyways.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Note<BR>
</B>When the display is disabled, both VRAM and OAM are accessable at any 
time. The downside is that the screen is blank (white) during this 
period, so that disabling the display would be recommended only during 
initialization.<BR>

<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="soundchannel4noise"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;Sound Channel 4 - Noise</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
This channel is used to output white noise. This is done by randomly 
switching the amplitude between high and low at a given frequency. 
Depending on the frequency the noise will appear 'harder' or 'softer'.<BR>
<BR>
It is also possible to influence the function of the random generator, 
so the that the output becomes more regular, resulting in a limited 
ability to output Tone instead of Noise.<BR>

</B>If your GB programs don't use sound then write 00h to this register to 
save 16% or more on GB power consumption. Disabeling the sound 
controller by clearing Bit 7 destroys the contents of all sound 
registers. Also, it is not possible to access any sound registers 
(execpt FF26) while the sound controller is disabled.<BR>

is restarted by setting the Initial flag (Bit 7 in NR14-NR44), the flag 
remains set until the sound length has expired (if enabled). A volume

</TD></TR></TABLE>Note: Most programs are repeatedly reading from this port several times 
(the first reads used as short delay, allowing the inputs to stabilize, 
and only the value from the last read actually used).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Usage in SGB software<BR>
</B>Beside for normal joypad input, SGB games mis-use the joypad register to 
output SGB command packets to the SNES, also, SGB programs may read out 
gamepad states from up to four different joypads which can be connected 
to the SNES.<BR>
See SGB description for details.<BR>
<BR>
<B>INT 60 - Joypad Interrupt<BR>
</B>Joypad interrupt is requested when any of the above Input lines changes 
from High to Low. Generally this should happen when a key becomes 
pressed (provided that the button/direction key is enabled by above 
Bit4/5), however, because of switch bounce, one or more High to Low 
transitions are usually produced both when pressing or releasing a key.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Using the Joypad Interrupt<BR>
</B>It's more or less useless for programmers, even when selecting both 
buttons and direction keys simultaneously it still cannot recognize all 
keystrokes, because in that case a bit might be already held low by a 
button key, and pressing the corresponding direction key would thus 
cause no difference. The only meaningful purpose of the keystroke 
interrupt would be to terminate STOP (low power) standby state.<BR>
Also, the joypad interrupt does not appear to work with CGB and GBA 
hardware (the STOP function can be still terminated by joypad keystrokes 
though).<BR>

<B>FF01 - SB - Serial transfer data (R/W)<BR>

<BR>
<B>FF02 - SC - Serial Transfer Control  (R/W)<BR>
</B><TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Bit 7 - Transfer Start Flag (0=No Transfer, 1=Start)
  Bit 1 - Clock Speed (0=Normal, 1=Fast) ** CGB Mode Only **
  Bit 0 - Shift Clock (0=External Clock, 1=Internal Clock)
</TD></TR></TABLE>The clock signal specifies the rate at which the eight data bits in SB 
(FF01) are transferred. When the gameboy is communicating with another 
gameboy (or other computer) then either one must supply internal clock, 
and the other one must use external clock.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Internal Clock<BR>
</B>In Non-CGB Mode the gameboy supplies an internal clock of 8192Hz only 
(allowing to transfer about 1 KByte per second). In CGB Mode four 
internal clock rates are available, depending on Bit 1 of the SC 
register, and on whether the CGB Double Speed Mode is used:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>    8192Hz -  1KB/s - Bit 1 cleared, Normal
   16384Hz -  2KB/s - Bit 1 cleared, Double Speed Mode
  262144Hz - 32KB/s - Bit 1 set,     Normal
  524288Hz - 64KB/s - Bit 1 set,     Double Speed Mode
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>External Clock<BR>
</B>The external clock is typically supplied by another gameboy, but might 
be supplied by another computer (for example if connected to a PCs 
parallel port), in that case the external clock may have any speed. Even 
the old/monochrome gameboy is reported to recognizes external clocks of 
up to 500KHz. And there is no limitiation into the other direction - 
even when suppling an external clock speed of "1 bit per month", then 
the gameboy will still eagerly wait for the next bit(s) to be 
transferred. It isn't required that the clock pulses are sent at an 
regular interval either.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Timeouts<BR>
</B>When using external clock then the transfer will not complete until the 
last bit is received. In case that the second gameboy isn't supplying a 
clock signal, if it gets turned off, or if there is no second gameboy 
connected at all) then transfer will never complete. For this reason the 
transfer procedure should use a timeout counter, and abort the 
communication if no response has been received during the timeout 
interval.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Delays and Synchronization<BR>
</B>The gameboy that is using internal clock should always execute a small 
delay between each transfer, in order to ensure that the opponent 
gameboy has enough time to prepare itself for the next transfer, ie. the 
gameboy with external clock must have set its transfer start bit before 
the gameboy with internal clock starts the transfer. Alternately, the 
two gameboys could switch between internal and external clock for each 
transferred byte to ensure synchronization.<BR>
<BR>
Transfer is initiated by setting the Transfer Start Flag. This bit is 
automatically set to 0 at the end of Transfer. Reading this bit can be 
used to determine if the transfer is still active.<BR>
<BR>
<B>INT 58 - Serial Interrupt<BR>
</B>When the transfer has completed (ie. after sending/receiving 8 bits, if 
any) then an interrupt is requested by setting Bit 3 of the IF Register 
(FF0F). When that interrupt is enabled, then the Serial Interrupt vector 
at 0058 is called.<BR>
<BR>
<B>XXXXXX...<BR>
</B><BR>
Transmitting and receiving serial data is done simultaneously. The 
received data is automatically stored in SB.<BR>
<BR>
The serial I/O port on the Gameboy is a very simple setup and is crude 
compared to standard RS-232 (IBM-PC) or RS-485 (Macintosh) serial ports. 
There are no start or stop bits.<BR>
<BR>
During a transfer, a byte is shifted in at the same time that a byte is 
shifted out. The rate of the shift is determined by whether the clock 
source is internal or external.<BR>
The most significant bit is shifted in and out first.<BR>
<BR>
When the internal clock is selected, it drives the clock pin on the game 
link port and it stays high when not used. During a transfer it will go 
low eight times to clock in/out each bit.<BR>
<BR>
The state of the last bit shifted out determines the state of the output 
line until another transfer takes place.<BR>
<BR>
If a serial transfer with internal clock is performed and no external 
GameBoy is present, a value of $FF will be received in the transfer.<BR>
<BR>
The following code causes $75 to be shifted out the serial port and a 
byte to be shifted into $FF01:<BR>

</B>This register is incremented at rate of 16384Hz (~16779Hz on SGB). In 
CGB Double Speed Mode it is incremented twice as fast, ie. at 32768Hz. 
Writing any value to this register resets it to 00h.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FF05 - TIMA - Timer counter (R/W)<BR>
</B>This timer is incremented by a clock frequency specified by the TAC

<B>INT 50 - Timer Interrupt<BR>
</B>Each time when the timer overflows (ie. when TIMA gets bigger than FFh), 
then an interrupt is requested by setting Bit 2 in the IF Register 
(FF0F). When that interrupt is enabled, then the CPU will execute it by 
calling the timer interrupt vector at 0050h.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Note<BR>
</B>The above described Timer is the built-in timer in the gameboy. It has 
nothing to do with the MBC3s battery buffered Real Time Clock - that's a

Banking Controllers.<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>When an interrupt signal changes from low to high, then the 
corresponding bit in the IF register becomes set. For example, Bit 0 
becomes set when the LCD controller enters into the V-Blank period.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Interrupt Requests<BR>
</B>Any set bits in the IF register are only &lt;requesting&gt; an interrupt to be 
executed. The actual &lt;execution&gt; happens only if both the IME flag, and 
the corresponding bit in the IE register are set, otherwise the 
interrupt 'waits' until both IME and IE allow its execution.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Interrupt Execution<BR>
</B>When an interrupt gets executed, the corresponding bit in the IF 
register becomes automatically reset by the CPU, and the IME flag 
becomes cleared (disabeling any further interrupts until the program 
re-enables the interrupts, typically by using the RETI instruction), and 
the corresponding Interrupt Vector (that are the addresses in range 
0040h-0060h, as shown in IE and IF register decriptions above) becomes 
called.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Manually Requesting/Discarding Interrupts<BR>
</B>As the CPU automatically sets and cleares the bits in the IF register it 
is usually not required to write to the IF register. However, the user 
may still do that in order to manually request (or discard) interrupts. 
As for real interrupts, a manually requested interrupt isn't executed 
unless/until IME and IE allow its execution.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Interrupt Priorities<BR>
</B>In the following three situations it might happen that more than 1 bit 
in the IF register are set, requesting more than one interrupt at once:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  1) More than one interrupt signal changed from Low
     to High at the same time.
  2) Several interrupts have been requested during a
     time in which IME/IE didn't allow these interrupts
     to be executed directly.
  3) The user has written a value with several "1" bits
     (for example 1Fh) to the IF register.
</TD></TR></TABLE>Provided that IME and IE allow the execution of more than one of the 
requested interrupts, then the interrupt with the highest priority 
becomes executed first. The priorities are ordered as the bits in the IE 
and IF registers, Bit 0 (V-Blank) having the highest priority, and Bit 4 
(Joypad) having the lowest priority.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Nested Interrupts<BR>
</B>The CPU automatically disables all other interrupts by setting IME=0 
when it executes an interrupt. Usually IME remains zero until the 
interrupt procedure returns (and sets IME=1 by the RETI instruction). 
However, if you want any other interrupts of lower or higher (or same) 
priority to be allowed to be executed from inside of the interrupt 
procedure, then you can place an EI instruction into the interrupt 
procedure.<BR>

<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="cgbregisters"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;CGB Registers</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Forward<BR>
</B>This chapter describes only CGB (Color Gameboy) registers that didn't 
fit into normal categories - most CGB registers are described in the 
chapter about Video Display (Color Palettes, VRAM Bank, VRAM DMA 
Transfers, and changed meaning of Bit 0 of LCDC Control register). Also, 
a changed bit is noted in the chapter about the Serial/Link port.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Unlocking CGB functions<BR>
</B>When using any CGB registers (including those in the Video/Link 
chapters), you must first unlock CGB features by changing byte 0143h in 
the cartridge header. Typically use a value of 80h for games which 
support both CGB and monochrome gameboys, and C0h for games which work 
on CGBs only. Otherwise, the CGB will operate in monochrome "Non CGB" 
compatibility mode.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Detecting CGB (and GBA) functions<BR>
</B>CGB hardware can be detected by examing the CPU accumulator (A-register) 
directly after startup. A value of 11h indicates CGB (or GBA) hardware, 
if so, CGB functions can be used (if unlocked, see above).<BR>
When A=11h, you may also examine Bit 0 of the CPUs B-Register to 
separate between CGB (bit cleared) and GBA (bit set), by that detection 
it is possible to use 'repaired' color palette data matching for GBA 
displays.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FF4D - KEY1 - CGB Mode Only - Prepare Speed Switch<BR>
</B><TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Bit 7: Current Speed     (0=Normal, 1=Double) (Read Only)
  Bit 0: Prepare Speed Switch (0=No, 1=Prepare) (Read/Write)
</TD></TR></TABLE>This register is used to prepare the gameboy to switch between CGB 
Double Speed Mode and Normal Speed Mode. The actual speed switch is 
performed by executing a STOP command after Bit 0 has been set. After 
that Bit 0 will be cleared automatically, and the gameboy will operate 
at the 'other' speed. The recommended speed switching procedure in 
pseudo code would be:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  IF KEY1_BIT7 &lt;&gt; DESIRED_SPEED THEN
    IE=00H       ;(FFFF)=00h
    JOYP=30H     ;(FF00)=30h
    KEY1=01H     ;(FF4D)=01h
    STOP         ;STOP
  ENDIF
</TD></TR></TABLE>The CGB is operating in Normal Speed Mode when it is turned on. Note 
that using the Double Speed Mode increases the power consumption, it 
would be recommended to use Single Speed whenever possible. However, the 
display will flicker (white) for a moment during speed switches, so this 
cannot be done permanentely.<BR>
In Double Speed Mode the following will operate twice as fast as normal:<BR>

<B>FF56 - RP - CGB Mode Only - Infrared Communications Port<BR>
</B>This register allows to input and output data through the CGBs built-in 
Infrared Port. When reading data, bit 6 and 7 must be set (and obviously 
Bit 0 must be cleared - if you don't want to receive your own gameboys 
IR signal). After sending or receiving data you should reset the 
register to 00h to reduce battery power consumption again.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Bit 0:   Write Data   (0=LED Off, 1=LED On)             (Read/Write)
  Bit 1:   Read Data    (0=Receiving IR Signal, 1=Normal) (Read Only)
  Bit 6-7: Data Read Enable (0=Disable, 3=Enable)         (Read/Write)
</TD></TR></TABLE>Note that the receiver will adapt itself to the normal level of IR 
pollution in the air, so if you would send a LED ON signal for a longer 
period, then the receiver would treat that as normal (=OFF) after a 
while. For example, a Philips TV Remote Control sends a series of 32 LED 
ON/OFF pulses (length 10us ON, 17.5us OFF each) instead of a permanent 
880us LED ON signal.<BR>
Even though being generally CGB compatible, the GBA does not include an 
infra-red port.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FF70 - SVBK - CGB Mode Only - WRAM Bank<BR>
</B>In CGB Mode 32 KBytes internal RAM are available. This memory is divided 
into 8 banks of 4 KBytes each. Bank 0 is always available in memory at 
C000-CFFF, Bank 1-7 can be selected into the address space at D000-DFFF.<BR>

<B>General Description<BR>
</B>Basically, the SGB (Super Gameboy) is an adapter cartridge that allows 
to play gameboy games on a SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System) 
gaming console. In detail, you plug the gameboy cartridge into the SGB 
cartridge, then plug the SGB cartridge into the SNES, and then connect 
the SNES to your TV Set. In result, games can be played and viewed on 
the TV Set, and are controlled by using the SNES joypad(s).<BR>
<BR>
<B>More Technical Description<BR>
</B>The SGB cartridge just contains a normal gameboy CPU and normal gameboy 
video controller. Normally the video signal from this controller would 
be sent to the LCD screen, however, in this special case the SNES read 
out the video signal and displays it on the TV set by using a special 
SNES BIOS ROM which is located in the SGB cartridge. Also, normal 
gameboy sound output is forwared to the SNES and output to the TV Set, 
vice versa, joypad input is forwared from the SNES controller(s) to the 
gameboy joypad inputs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Normal Monochrome Games<BR>
</B>Any gameboy games which have been designed for normal monochrome 
handheld gameboys will work with the SGB hardware as well. The SGB will 
apply a four color palette to these games by replacing the normal four 
grayshades. The 160x144 pixel gamescreen is displayed in the middle of 
the 256x224 pixel SNES screen (the unused area is filled by a screen 
border bitmap). The user may access built-in menues, allowing to change 
color palette data, to select between several pre-defined borders, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Games that have been designed to support SGB functions may also access 
the following additional features:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Colorized Game Screen<BR>
</B>There's limited ability to colorize the gamescreen by assigning custom 
color palettes to each 20x18 display characters, however, this works 
mainly for static display data such like title screens or status bars, 
the 20x18 color attribute map is non-scrollable, and it is not possible 
to assign separate colors to moveable foreground sprites (OBJs), so that 
animated screen regions will be typically restricted to using a single 
palette of four colors only.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SNES Foreground Sprites<BR>
</B>Up to 24 foreground sprites (OBJs) of 8x8 or 16x16 pixels, 16 colors can 
be displayed. When replacing (or just overlaying) the normal gameboy 
OBJs by SNES OBJs it'd be thus possible to display OBJs with other 
colors than normal background area. This method doesn't appear to be 
very popular, even though it appears to be quite easy to implement, 
however, the bottommost character line of the gamescreen will be masked 
out because this area is used to transfer OAM data to the SNES.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The SGB Border<BR>
</B>The possibly most popular and most impressive feature is to replace the 
default SGB screen border by a custom bitmap which is stored in the game 
cartridge.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Multiple Joypads<BR>
</B>Up to four joypads can be conected to the SNES, and SGB software may 
read-out each of these joypads separately, allowing up to four players 
to play the same game simultaneously. Unlike for multiplayer handheld 
games, this requires only one game cartridge and only one SGB/SNES, and 
no link cables are required, the downside is that all players must share 
the same display screen.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sound Functions<BR>
</B>Beside for normal gameboy sound, a number of digital sound effects is 
pre-defined in the SNES BIOS, these effects may be accessed quite 
easily. Programmers whom are familiar with SNES sounds may also access 
the SNES sound chip, or use the SNES MIDI engine directly in order to 
produce other sound effects or music.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Taking Control of the SNES CPU<BR>
</B>Finally, it is possible to write program code or data into SNES memory, 
and to execute such program code by using the SNES CPU.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SGB System Clock<BR>
</B>Because the SGB is synchronized to the SNES CPU, the gameboy system 
clock is directly chained to the SNES system clock. In result, the 
gameboy CPU, video controller, timers, and sound frequencies will be all 
operated approx 2.4% faster as by normal gameboys.<BR>
Basically, this should be no problem, and the game will just run a 
little bit faster. However sensitive musicians may notice that sound 
frequencies are a bit too high, programs that support SGB functions may 
avoid this effect by reducing frequencies of gameboy sounds when having 
detected SGB hardware.<BR>
Also, I think that I've heard that SNES models which use a 50Hz display 
refresh rate (rather than 60Hz) are resulting in respectively slower 
SGB/gameboy timings ???<BR>

<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="sgbunlockinganddetectingsgbfunctions"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;SGB Unlocking and Detecting SGB Functions</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Cartridge Header<BR>
</B>SGB games are required to have a cartridge header with Nintendo and 
proper checksum just as normal gameboy games. Also, two special entries 
must be set in order to unlock SGB functions:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  146h - SGB Flag - Must be set to 03h for SGB games
  14Bh - Old Licensee Code - Must be set 33h for SGB games
</TD></TR></TABLE>When these entries aren't set, the game will still work just like all 
'monochrome' gameboy games, but it cannot access any of the special SGB 
functions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Detecting SGB hardware<BR>
</B>The recommended detection method is to send a MLT_REQ command which 
enables two (or four) joypads. A normal handheld gameboy will ignore 
this command, a SGB will now return incrementing joypad IDs each time 
when deselecting keyboard lines (see MLT_REQ description for details).<BR>
Now read-out joypad state/IDs several times, and if the ID-numbers are 
changing, then it is a SGB (a normal gameboy would typically always 
return 0Fh as ID). Finally, when not intending to use more than one 
joypad, send another MLT_REQ command in order to re-disable the 
multi-controller mode.<BR>
Detection works regardless of whether and how many joypads are 
physically connected to the SNES. However, detection works only when 
having unlocked SGB functions in the cartridge header, as described 
above. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Separating between SGB and SGB2<BR>
</B>It is also possible to separate between SGB and SGB2 models by examining 
the inital value of the accumulator (A-register) directly after startup.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  01h  SGB or Normal Gameboy (DMG)
  FFh  SGB2 or Pocket Gameboy
  11h  CGB or GBA
</TD></TR></TABLE>Because values 01h and FFh are shared for both handhelds and SGBs, it is 
still required to use the above MLT_REQ detection procedure. As far as I 
know the SGB2 doesn't have any extra features which'd require separate 
SGB2 detection except for curiosity purposes, for example, the game 
"Tetris DX" chooses to display an alternate SGB border on SGB2s.<BR>
<BR>
Reportedly, some SGB models include link ports (just like handheld 
gameboy) (my own SGB does not have such an port), possibly this feature 
is available in SGB2-type models only ???<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="sgbcommandpackettransfers"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;SGB Command Packet Transfers</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
Command packets (aka Register Files) are transferred from the gameboy to 
the SNES by using P14 and P15 output lines of the JOYPAD register 
(FF00h), these lines are normally used to select the two rows in the 
gameboy keyboard matrix (which still works).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Transferring Bits<BR>
</B>A command packet transfer must be initiated by setting both P14 and P15 
to LOW, this will reset and start the SNES packet receiving program. 
Data is then transferred (LSB first), setting P14=LOW will indicate a 
"0" bit, and setting P15=LOW will indicate a "1" bit. For example:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>       RESET 0   0   1   1   0   1   0
  P14  --_---_---_-----------_-------_--...
  P15  --_-----------_---_-------_------...
</TD></TR></TABLE>Data and reset pulses must be kept LOW for at least 5us. P14 and P15 
must be kept both HIGH for at least 15us between any pulses.<BR>
Obviously, it'd be no good idea to access the JOYPAD register during the 
transfer, for example, in case that your VBlank interrupt procedure 
reads-out joypad states each frame, be sure to disable that interrupt 
during the transfer (or disable only the joypad procedure by using a 
software flag).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Transferring Packets<BR>
</B>Each packet is invoked by a RESET pulse, then 128 bits of data are 
transferred (16 bytes, LSB of first byte first), and finally, a "0"-bit 
must be transferred as stop bit. The structure of normal packets is:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>   1 PULSE Reset
   1 BYTE  Command Code*8+Length
  15 BYTES Parameter Data
   1 BIT   Stop Bit (0)
</TD></TR></TABLE>The above 'Length' indicates the total number of packets (1-7, including 
the first packet) which will be sent, ie. if more than 15 parameter 
bytes are used, then further packet(s) will follow, as such:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>   1 PULSE Reset
  16 BYTES Parameter Data
   1 BIT   Stop Bit (0)
</TD></TR></TABLE>By using all 7 packets, up to 111 data bytes (15+16*6) may be sent.<BR>
Unused bytes at the end of the last packet must be set to zero.<BR>
A 60ms (4 frames) delay should be invoked between each packet transfer.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="sgbvramtransfers"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;SGB VRAM Transfers</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Overview<BR>
</B>Beside for the packet transfer method, larger data blocks of 4KBytes can 
be transferred by using the video signal. These transfers are invoked by 
first sending one of the commands with the ending _TRN (by using normal 
packet transfer), the 4K data block is then read-out by the SNES from 
gameboy display memory during the next frame.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Transfer Data<BR>
</B>Normally, transfer data should be stored at 8000h-8FFFh in gameboy VRAM,<BR>
even though the SNES receives the data in from display scanlines, it 
will automatically re-produce the same ordering of bits and bytes, as 
being originally stored at 8000h-8FFFh in gameboy memory.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Preparing the Display<BR>
</B>The above method works only when recursing the following things: BG Map 
must display unsigned characters 00h-FFh on the screen; 00h..13h in 
first line, 14h..27h in next line, etc. The gameboy display must be 
enabled, the display may not be scrolled, OBJ sprites should not overlap 
the background tiles, the BGP palette register must be set to E4h.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Transfer Time<BR>
</B>Note that the transfer data should be prepared in VRAM &lt;before&gt; sending 
the transfer command packet. The actual transfer starts at the beginning 
of the next frame after the command has been sent, and the transfer ends 
at the end of the 5th frame after the command has been sent (not 
counting the frame in which the command has been sent).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Avoiding Screen Garbage<BR>
</B>The display will contain 'garbage' during the transfer, this dirt-effect 
can be avoided by freezing the screen (in the state which has been 
displayed before the transfer) by using the MASK_EN command.<BR>
Of course, this works only when actually executing the game on a SGB 
(and not on normal handheld gameboys), it'd be thus required to detect 
the presence of SGB hardware before blindly sending VRAM data.<BR>

<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="sgbcolorpalettesoverview"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;SGB Color Palettes Overview</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Available SNES Palettes<BR>
</B>The SGB/SNES provides 8 palettes of 16 colors each, each color may be 
defined out of a selection of 34768 colors (15 bit). Palettes 0-3 are 
used to colorize the gamescreen, only the first four colors of each of 
these palettes are used. Palettes 4-7 are used for the SGB Border, all 
16 colors of each of these palettes may be used.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Color 0 Restriction<BR>
</B>Color 0 of each of the eight palettes is transparent, causing the 
backdrop color to be displayed instead. The backdrop color is typically 
defined by the most recently color being assigned to Color 0 (regardless 
of the palette number being used for that operation).<BR>
Effectively, gamescreen palettes can have only three custom colors each, 
and SGB border palettes only 15 colors each, additionally, color 0 can 
be used for for all palettes, which will then all share the same color 
though.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Translation of Grayshades into Colors<BR>
</B>Because the SGB/SNES reads out the gameboy video controllers display 
signal, it translates the different grayshades from the signal into SNES 
colors as such:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  White       --&gt;  Color 0
  Light Gray  --&gt;  Color 1
  Dark Gray   --&gt;  Color 2
  Black       --&gt;  Color 3
</TD></TR></TABLE>Note that gameboy colors 0-3 are assigned to user-selectable grayshades 
by the gameboys BGP, OBP1, and OBP2 registers. There is thus no fixed 
relationship between gameboy colors 0-3 and SNES colors 0-3.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Using Gameboy BGP/OBP Registers<BR>
</B>A direct translation of color 0-3 into color 0-3 may be produced by 
setting BGP/OBP registers to a value of 0E4h each. However, in case that 
your program uses black background for example, then you may internally 
assign background as "White" at the gameboy side by BGP/OBP registers 
(which is then interpreted as SNES color 0, which is shared for all SNES 
palettes). The advantage is that you may define Color 0 as Black at the 
SNES side, and may assign custom colors for Colors 1-3 of each SNES 
palette.<BR>
<BR>
<B>System Color Palette Memory<BR>
</B>Beside for the actually visible palettes, up to 512 palettes of 4 colors 
each may be defined in SNES RAM. Basically, this is completely 
irrelevant because the palettes are just stored in RAM whithout any 
relationship to the displayed picture, anyways, these pre-defined colors 
may be transferred to actually visible palettes slightly faster as when 
transferring palette data by separate command packets.<BR>

<B>Reading Multiple Controllers (Joypads)<BR>
</B>When having enabled multiple controllers by MLT_REQ, data for each 
joypad can be read out through JOYPAD register (FF00) as follows: First 
set P14 and P15 both HIGH (deselect both Buttons and Cursor keys), you

the following joypad input:<BR>

Cursor lines, and read-out joypad state as normally. When completed, set 
P14 and P15 back HIGH, this automatically increments the joypad number 
(or restarts counting once reached the lastmost joypad). Repeat the

for the gameboy window to be displayed inside. Reportedly, 
non-transparent border data will cover the gameboy window.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SGB Command 18h - OBJ_TRN<BR>
</B>Used to transfer OBJ attributes to SNES OAM memory. Unlike all other 
functions with the ending _TRN, this function does not use the usual 
one-shot 4KBytes VRAM transfer method.<BR>
Instead, when enabled (below execute bit set), data is permanently (each 
frame) read out from the lower character line of the gameboy screen. To 
suppress garbage on the display, the lower line is masked, and only the 
upper 20x17 characters of the gameboy window are used - the masking 
method is unknwon - frozen, black, or recommended to be covered by the 
SGB border, or else ??? Also, when the function is enabled, "system 
attract mode is not performed" - whatever that means ???<BR>

          These color entries are ignored if above Control Bit 1 is zero.
          Because each OBJ palette consists of 16 colors, four system
          palette entries (of 4 colors each) are transferred into each
          OBJ palette. The system palette numbers are not required to be
          aligned to a multiple of four, and will wrap to palette number
          0 when exceeding 511. For example, a value of 511 would copy
          system palettes 511, 0, 1, 2 to the SNES OBJ palette.

the gameboy screen. As for normal 4KByte VRAM transfers, this area 
should not be scrolled, should not be overlapped by gameboy OBJs, and 
the gameboy BGP palette register should be set up properly. By following

<BR>
<B>The Zero Flag (Z)<BR>
</B>This bit becomes set (1) if the result of an operation has been zero 
(0). Used for conditional jumps.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Carry Flag (C, or Cy)<BR>
</B>Becomes set when the result of an addition became bigger than FFh (8bit) 
or FFFFh (16bit). Or when the result of a subtraction or comparision 
became less than zero (much as for Z80 and 80x86 CPUs, but unlike as for 
65XX and ARM CPUs). Also the flag becomes set when a rotate/shift 
operation has shifted-out a "1"-bit.<BR>
Used for conditional jumps, and for instructions such like ADC, SBC, RL, 
RLA, etc.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The BCD Flags (N, H)<BR>
</B>These flags are (rarely) used for the DAA instruction only, N Indicates 
whether the previous instruction has been an addition or subtraction, 
and H indicates carry for lower 4bits of the result, also for DAA, the C 
flag must indicate carry for upper 8bits.<BR>
After adding/subtracting two BCD numbers, DAA is intended to convert the 
result into BCD format; BCD numbers are ranged from 00h to 99h rather 
than 00h to FFh.<BR>
Because C and H flags must contain carry-outs for each digit, DAA cannot 
be used for 16bit operations (which have 4 digits), or for INC/DEC 
operations (which do not affect C-flag).<BR>

<B>Comparision with 8080<BR>
</B>Basically, the gameboy CPU works more like an older 8080 CPU rather than 
like a more powerful Z80 CPU. It is, however, supporting CB-prefixed 
instructions. Also, all known gameboy assemblers using the more obvious 
Z80-style syntax, rather than the chaotic 8080-style syntax.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Comparision with Z80<BR>
</B>Any DD-, ED-, and FD-prefixed instructions are missing, that means no 
IX-, IY-registers, no block commands, and some other missing commands.<BR>
All exchange instructions have been removed (including total absence of 
second register set), 16bit memory accesses are mostly missing, and 
16bit arithmetic functions are heavily cut-down.<BR>
The gameboy has no IN/OUT instructions, instead I/O ports are accessed 
directly by normal LD instructions, or by special LD (FF00+n) opcodes.<BR>
The sign and parity/overflow flags have been removed.<BR>
The gameboy operates approximately as fast as a 4MHz Z80 (8MHz in CGB 
double speed mode), execution time of all instructions has been rounded 
up to a multiple of 4 cycles though.<BR>

An internal information area is located at 0100-014F in<BR>
each cartridge. It contains the following values:<BR>
<BR>
<B>0100-0103 - Entry Point<BR>
</B>After displaying the Nintendo Logo, the built-in boot procedure jumps to 
this address (100h), which should then jump to the actual main program

followed by a JP 0150h instruction. But not always.<BR>
<BR>
<B>0104-0133 - Nintendo Logo<BR>

it has displayed it), and LOCKS ITSELF UP if these bytes are incorrect. 
A CGB verifies only the first 18h bytes of the bitmap, but others (for

<BR>
<B>0134-0143 - Title<BR>
</B>Title of the game in UPPER CASE ASCII. If it is less than 16 characters 
then the remaining bytes are filled with 00's. When inventing the CGB, 
Nintendo has reduced the length of this area to 15 characters, and some 
months later they had the fantastic idea to reduce it to 11 characters 
only. The new meaning of the ex-title bytes is described below.<BR>
<BR>
<B>013F-0142 - Manufacturer Code<BR>
</B>In older cartridges this area has been part of the Title (see above), in 
newer cartridges this area contains an 4 character uppercase 
manufacturer code. Purpose and Deeper Meaning unknown.<BR>
<BR>
<B>0143 - CGB Flag<BR>
</B>In older cartridges this byte has been part of the Title (see above). In 
CGB cartridges the upper bit is used to enable CGB functions. This is 
required, otherwise the CGB switches itself into Non-CGB-Mode. Typical 
values are:<BR>

<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="memorybankcontrollers"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;Memory Bank Controllers</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
As the gameboys 16 bit address bus offers only limited space for ROM and 
RAM addressing, many games are using Memory Bank Controllers (MBCs) to 
expand the available address space by bank switching. These MBC chips 
are located in the game cartridge (ie. not in the gameboy itself), 
several different MBC types are available:<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#none32kbyteromonly">None (32KByte ROM only)</A><BR>
<A HREF="#mbc1max2mbyteromandor32kbyteram">MBC1 (max 2MByte ROM and/or 32KByte RAM)</A><BR>

<A HREF="#huc1mbcwithinfraredcontroller">HuC1 (MBC with Infrared Controller)</A><BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#mbctimingissues">MBC Timing Issues</A><BR>
<BR>
In each cartridge, the required (or preferred) MBC type should be 
specified in byte at 0147h of the ROM. (As described in the chapter 
about The Cartridge Header.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="none32kbyteromonly"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;None (32KByte ROM only)</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
Small games of not more than 32KBytes ROM do not require a MBC chip for 
ROM banking. The ROM is directly mapped to memory at 0000-7FFFh. 
Optionally up to 8KByte of RAM could be connected at A000-BFFF, even 
though that could require a tiny MBC-like circuit, but no real MBC chip.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="mbc1max2mbyteromandor32kbyteram"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;MBC1 (max 2MByte ROM and/or 32KByte RAM)</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
This is the first MBC chip for the gameboy. Any newer MBC chips are 
working similiar, so that is relative easy to upgrade a program from one 
MBC chip to another - or even to make it compatible to several different 
types of MBCs.<BR>
<BR>
Note that the memory in range 0000-7FFF is used for both reading from 
ROM, and for writing to the MBCs Control Registers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>0000-3FFF - ROM Bank 00 (Read Only)<BR>
</B>This area always contains the first 16KBytes of the cartridge ROM.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4000-7FFF - ROM Bank 01-7F (Read Only)<BR>
</B>This area may contain any of the further 16KByte banks of the ROM, 
allowing to address up to 125 ROM Banks (almost 2MByte). As described 
below, bank numbers 20h, 40h, and 60h cannot be used, resulting in the 
odd amount of 125 banks.<BR>
<BR>
<B>A000-BFFF - RAM Bank 00-03, if any (Read/Write)<BR>
</B>This area is used to address external RAM in the cartridge (if any). 
External RAM is often battery buffered, allowing to store game positions 
or high score tables, even if the gameboy is turned off, or if the 
cartridge is removed from the gameboy. Available RAM sizes are: 2KByte 
(at A000-A7FF), 8KByte (at A000-BFFF), and 32KByte (in form of four 8K 
banks at A000-BFFF).<BR>
<BR>
<B>0000-1FFF - RAM Enable (Write Only)<BR>
</B>Before external RAM can be read or written, it must be enabled by 
writing to this address space. It is recommended to disable external RAM 
after accessing it, in order to protect its contents from damage during 
power down of the gameboy. Usually the following values are used:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  00h  Disable RAM (default)
  0Ah  Enable RAM
</TD></TR></TABLE>Practically any value with 0Ah in the lower 4 bits enables RAM, and any 
other value disables RAM.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2000-3FFF - ROM Bank Number (Write Only)<BR>
</B>Writing to this address space selects the lower 5 bits of the ROM Bank 
Number (in range 01-1Fh). When 00h is written, the MBC translates that 
to bank 01h also. That doesn't harm so far, because ROM Bank 00h can be 
always directly accessed by reading from 0000-3FFF.<BR>
But (when using the register below to specify the upper ROM Bank bits), 
the same happens for Bank 20h, 40h, and 60h. Any attempt to address 
these ROM Banks will select Bank 21h, 41h, and 61h instead.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4000-5FFF - RAM Bank Number - or - Upper Bits of ROM Bank Number (Write Only)<BRBR>
</B>This 2bit register can be used to select a RAM Bank in range from 
00-03h, or to specify the upper two bits (Bit 5-6) of the ROM Bank 
number, depending on the current ROM/RAM Mode. (See below.)<BR>
<BR>
<B>6000-7FFF - ROM/RAM Mode Select (Write Only)<BR>
</B>This 1bit Register selects whether the two bits of the above register 
should be used as upper two bits of the ROM Bank, or as RAM Bank Number.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  00h = ROM Banking Mode (up to 8KByte RAM, 2MByte ROM) (default)
  01h = RAM Banking Mode (up to 32KByte RAM, 512KByte ROM)
</TD></TR></TABLE>The program may freely switch between both modes, the only limitiation 
is that only RAM Bank 00h can be used during Mode 0, and only ROM Banks 
00-1Fh can be used during Mode 1.<BR>

<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="mbc2max256kbyteromand512x4bitsram"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;MBC2 (max 256KByte ROM and 512x4 bits RAM)</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>0000-3FFF - ROM Bank 00 (Read Only)<BR>
</B>Same as for MBC1.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4000-7FFF - ROM Bank 01-0F (Read Only)<BR>
</B>Same as for MBC1, but only a total of 16 ROM banks is supported.<BR>
<BR>
<B>A000-A1FF - 512x4bits RAM, built-in into the MBC2 chip (Read/Write)<BR>
</B>The MBC2 doesn't support external RAM, instead it includes 512x4 bits of 
built-in RAM (in the MBC2 chip itself). It still requires an external 
battery to save data during power-off though.<BR>
As the data consists of 4bit values, only the lower 4 bits of the 
"bytes" in this memory area are used.<BR>
<BR>
<B>0000-1FFF - RAM Enable (Write Only)<BR>
</B>The least significant bit of the upper address byte must be zero to 
enable/disable cart RAM. For example the following addresses can be used 
to enable/disable cart RAM: 0000-00FF, 0200-02FF, 0400-04FF, ..., 
1E00-1EFF.<BR>
The suggested address range to use for MBC2 ram enable/disable is 
0000-00FF.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2000-3FFF - ROM Bank Number (Write Only)<BR>
</B>Writing a value (XXXXBBBB - X = Don't cares, B = bank select bits) into 
2000-3FFF area will select an appropriate ROM bank at 4000-7FFF.<BR>
<BR>
The least significant bit of the upper address byte must be one to 
select a ROM bank. For example the following addresses can be used to 
select a ROM bank: 2100-21FF, 2300-23FF, 2500-25FF, ..., 3F00-3FFF.<BR>
The suggested address range to use for MBC2 rom bank selection is 
2100-21FF.<BR>

Beside for the ability to access up to 2MB ROM (128 banks), and 32KB RAM 
(4 banks), the MBC3 also includes a built-in Real Time Clock (RTC). The 
RTC requires an external 32.768 kHz Quartz Oscillator, and an external 
battery (if it should continue to tick when the gameboy is turned off).<BR>
<BR>
<B>0000-3FFF - ROM Bank 00 (Read Only)<BR>
</B>Same as for MBC1.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4000-7FFF - ROM Bank 01-7F (Read Only)<BR>
</B>Same as for MBC1, except that accessing banks 20h, 40h, and 60h is 
supported now.<BR>
<BR>
<B>A000-BFFF - RAM Bank 00-03, if any (Read/Write)<BR>
A000-BFFF - RTC Register 08-0C (Read/Write)<BR>
</B>Depending on the current Bank Number/RTC Register selection (see below), 
this memory space is used to access an 8KByte external RAM Bank, or a 
single RTC Register.<BR>
<BR>
<B>0000-1FFF - RAM and Timer Enable (Write Only)<BR>
</B>Mostly the same as for MBC1, a value of 0Ah will enable reading and 
writing to external RAM - and to the RTC Registers! A value of 00h will 
disable either.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2000-3FFF - ROM Bank Number (Write Only)<BR>
</B>Same as for MBC1, except that the whole 7 bits of the RAM Bank Number 
are written directly to this address. As for the MBC1, writing a value 
of 00h, will select Bank 01h instead. All other values 01-7Fh select the 
corresponding ROM Banks.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4000-5FFF - RAM Bank Number - or - RTC Register Select (Write Only)<BR>
</B>As for the MBC1s RAM Banking Mode, writing a value in range for 00h-03h 
maps the corresponding external RAM Bank (if any) into memory at 
A000-BFFF.<BR>
When writing a value of 08h-0Ch, this will map the corresponding RTC 
register into memory at A000-BFFF. That register could then be 
read/written by accessing any address in that area, typically that is 
done by using address A000.<BR>
<BR>
<B>6000-7FFF - Latch Clock Data (Write Only)<BR>
</B>When writing 00h, and then 01h to this register, the current time 
becomes latched into the RTC registers. The latched data will not change 
until it becomes latched again, by repeating the write 00h-&gt;01h 
procedure.<BR>
This is supposed for &lt;reading&gt; from the RTC registers. It is proof to 
read the latched (frozen) time from the RTC registers, while the clock 
itself continues to tick in background.<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>The Halt Flag is supposed to be set before &lt;writing&gt; to the RTC 
Registers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Day Counter<BR>
</B>The total 9 bits of the Day Counter allow to count days in range from 
0-511 (0-1FFh). The Day Counter Carry Bit becomes set when this value 
overflows. In that case the Carry Bit remains set until the program does 
reset it.<BR>
Note that you can store an offset to the Day Counter in battery RAM. For 
example, every time you read a non-zero Day Counter, add this Counter to 
the offset in RAM, and reset the Counter to zero. This method allows to 
count any number of days, making your program Year-10000-Proof, provided 
that the cartridge gets used at least every 511 days.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Delays<BR>
</B>When accessing the RTC Registers it is recommended to execute a 4ms 
delay (4 Cycles in Normal Speed Mode) between the separate accesses.<BR>

Double Speed during periods which use only code and data which is

When the GameBoy is powered up, a 256 byte program starting at memory 
location 0 is executed. This program is located in a ROM inside the 
GameBoy. The first thing the program does is read the cartridge 
locations from $104 to $133 and place this graphic of a Nintendo logo on 
the screen at the top. This image is then scrolled until it is in the 
middle of the screen. Two musical notes are then played on the internal 
speaker. Again, the cartridge locations $104 to $133 are read but this 
time they are compared with a table in the internal rom. If any byte 
fails to compare, then the GameBoy stops comparing bytes and simply 
halts all operations. If all locations compare the same, then the 
GameBoy starts adding all of the bytes in the cartridge from $134 to 
$14d. A value of 25 decimal is added to this total. If the least 
significant byte of the result is a not a zero, then the GameBoy will 
stop doing anything. If it is a zero, then the internal ROM is disabled 
and cartridge program execution begins at location $100 with the 
following register values:<BR>

It is not a good idea to assume the above values will always exist. A 
later version GameBoy could contain different values than these at

Please note that GameBoy internal RAM on power up contains random data. 
All of the GameBoy emulators tend to set all RAM to value $00 on entry.<BR>

<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="pwrusingthehaltinstruction"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;PWR Using the HALT Instruction</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
It is recommended that the HALT instruction be used whenever possible to 
reduce power consumption & extend the life of the batteries. This 
command stops the system clock reducing the power consumption of both 
the CPU and ROM.<BR>
<BR>
The CPU will remain suspended until an interrupt occurs at which point 
the interrupt is serviced and then the instruction immediately following 
the HALT is executed.<BR>
<BR>
Depending on how much CPU time is required by a game, the HALT 
instruction can extend battery life anywhere from 5 to 50% or possibly 
more.<BR>
<BR>
When waiting for a vblank event, this would be a BAD example:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  @@wait:
   ld   a,(0FF44h)      ;LY
   cp   a,144
   jr   nz,@@wait
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
A better example would be a procedure as shown below. In this case the 
vblank interrupt must be enabled, and your vblank interrupt procedure 
must set vblank_flag to a non-zero value.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>   ld   hl,vblank_flag  ;hl=pointer to vblank_flag
   xor  a               ;a=0
  @@wait:               ;wait...
   halt                 ;suspend CPU - wait for ANY interrupt
   cp   a,(hl)          ;vblank flag still zero?
   jr   z,@@wait        ;wait more if zero
   ld   (hl),a          ;set vblank_flag back to zero
</TD></TR></TABLE>The vblank_flag is used to determine whether the HALT period has been 
terminated by a vblank interrupt, or by another interrupt. In case that 
your program has all other interrupts disabled, then it would be proof 
to replace the above procedure by a single HALT instruction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="pwrusingthestopinstruction"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;PWR Using the STOP Instruction</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
The STOP instruction is intended to switch the gameboy into VERY low 
power standby mode. For example, a program may use this feature when it 
hasn't sensed keyboard input for a longer period (assuming that somebody 
forgot to turn off the gameboy).<BR>
<BR>
Before invoking STOP, it might be required to disable Sound and Video 
manually (as well as IR-link port in CGB). Much like HALT, the STOP 
state is terminated by interrupt events - in this case this would be 
commonly a joypad interrupt. The joypad register might be required to be 
prepared for STOP either.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="pwrdisabelingthesoundcontroller"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;PWR Disabeling the Sound Controller</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
If your programs doesn't use sound at all (or during some periods) then 
write 00h to register FF26 to save 16% or more on GB power consumption.<BR>
Sound can be turned back on by writing 80h to the same register, all 
sound registers must be then re-initialized.<BR>
When the gameboy becomes turned on, sound is enabled by default, and 
must be turned off manually when not used.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="pwrnotusingcgbdoublespeedmode"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;PWR Not using CGB Double Speed Mode</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
Because CGB Double Speed mode consumes more power, it'd be recommended 
to use normal speed when possible.<BR>
There's limited ability to switch between both speeds, for example, a 
game might use normal speed in the title screen, and double speed in the 
game, or vice versa.<BR>
However, during speed switch the display collapses for a short moment, 
so that it'd be no good idea to alter speeds within active game or title 
screen periods.<BR>

Most of the above power saving methods will produce best results when 
using efficient and tight assembler code which requires as less CPU 
power as possible. Thus, experienced old-school programmers will 
(hopefully) produce lower power consumption, as than HLL-programming 
teenagers, for example.<BR>

There is a flaw in the GameBoy hardware that causes trash to be written 
to OAM RAM if the following commands are used while their 16-bit content 
is in the range of $FE00 to $FEFF:<BR>
